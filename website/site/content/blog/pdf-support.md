Insomnia tries to display HTTP responses in the most friendly way possible.
For example, HTML files are rendered as web pages, images and SVGs are displayed as bitmaps, 
and JSON and XML responses are syntax highlighted and interactive. Now, thanks to a community 
[contribution by Antoine38660](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/pull/325), Insomnia
is able to display PDF files using Mozilla's [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) 
project.
