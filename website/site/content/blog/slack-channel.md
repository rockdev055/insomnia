Since the [Open Source Announcement](/blog/open-source-announcement/) yesterday, many
people have submitted bugs, asked questions, and proposed features via GitHub issues. 
However, this is not always the most suitable medium for discussion. Now, Thanks
to a [suggestion](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/issues/188) by `ctnordcl`, I've
created a public Slack Team that anyone can join.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<a class="button" href="https://chat.insomnia.rest">Join Insomnia on Slack</a>
</p>

So, head on over, introduce yourself, and join in on the discussion. 

See you there!
