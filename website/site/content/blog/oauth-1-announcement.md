Starting with **v5.11.0**, Insomnia users can now authenticate using the 
[OAuth 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) authentication framework!

OAuth 1.0 support was an extremely popular request so I'm proud to finally announce that
it's finished. In fact, it was the most popular
[issue](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/issues/197) on GitHub for a long time. I'd 
like to give a huge thanks to [besolov](https://github.com/besolov) who stepped up and 
provided then initial implementation, and to [EpocDotFr](https://github.com/EpocDotFr) as well 
for doing initial testing.

Since OAuth is a fairly complicated framework, please report any bugs or issues you run into
on [GitHub](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia/issues). 

Thanks!
