October saw a large increase of traffic due to a very positive
[Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15536364) that got a lot af attention.
This also produced a large ripple effect of sharing on other social networks like Twitter and
Facebook.

This influx of users was obviously great for business, but it was also great for morale. 
Insomnia has been on Hacker News multiple times before, but this time was different. This 
was the first time where people _actually_ knew what Insomnia was and had something to say 
about it instead of the usual "How is this different than Postman?" I can't tell you have 
good that feels. 

Okay, let's dive into this month's metrics.

There's one every month!_

## Metrics Overview

Basically everything is up this month, which is awesome. If only it were easier to get attention
on Hacker News.

Daily active users had a big spike, which is clearly visible in the following graph. Notice how
it also drops off the following week as new users don't continue to use the app.

Revenue is also up, but this is less related to the traffic spike. Revenue usually trails behind
traffic spikes by a few weeks in order to get to know the app before committing to a purchase.

And that's it! There are big plans for November including launching both a long-awaited feature 
a new documentation site! October's success has left plenty of fuel in the tank to accomplish
both of these so I'm excited to see what happens.

Be sure to stay tuned to see how that goes!
