April was the most difficult month yet.
I [Launched Version 5.0](/blog/insomnia-5-announcement/) with 
some large new features, and the release went fairly smoothly.
However, 5.0 introduced a major compatibility problem for subset of Linux and
OSX versions. This unexpected headache piled on a lot of stressful
work, leading to a dark spiral of burnout. I ended taking the second half 
of the month off (for the most part) to recover.

## April Metrics Overview

Since inception, the rate of growth of Insomnia's user base has been steadily decreasing
every month, from +30% to +10%. This decrease is to be expected as Insomnia outgrows
the early adopter market. However, if this number drops below 10% I'll be worried.
Revenue growth is still very healthy though, which is awesome to see.

| Metric                    | Value This Month | Change    | Reaction   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Active App Users          | 24,203           | +10%      | &#x1f610;  |        
| New App Users             | 10,035           | +7%       | &#x1f610;  |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | $660             | +35%      | &#128578;  |
| Recognized Revenue        | $1045            | +63%      | &#x1f602;  |
| New Trial Customers       | 224              | +10%      | &#128551;  |
| New Paying Customers      | 19               | -13%      | &#128551;  |
| Churned Customers         | 4                | +33%      | &#128551;  |
| Trial Conversion Rate     | 8%               | -27%      | &#128578;  |

The following chart does a great job of visualizing the user growth decline. 
If you connect the peaks with a straight line you'll see that growth has been roughly
linear since January. This is likely due to low word-of-mouth referral traffic, which is
perplexing because Insomnia users are consistently fanatical.

MRR growth has also been declining steadily over the last few months, although it's still
in a healthy place at +35%.

## Wrap Up

I've mentioned in previous posts that I want to spend more time on content and marketing 
but have yet to have the motivation to do so. Now that growth is a problem, I
have no choice. Everyone knows that building a great product does not guarantee success
and I'm beginning to live that reality. It's time to make some changes.

As always, let me know if you have any feedback or thoughts, and enjoy the app!
