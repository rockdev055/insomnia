Well, another month has passed and Insomnia continues to grow 📈. Unfortunately, number of 
active users didn't budge, but **MRR increased by a whopping 45% 🤑!** That's is the largest 
increase Insomnia has seen in a long time, and I attribute most of it to one simple trick:
**asking users to pay**. _Keep reading for more on this._

## Metrics Overview

Last month, the user base didn't grow at all. This would normally be worrying but, honestly,
the huge increase in MRR takes away all the worry I might have of that. I'm hoping user growth
will be back up to health levels next month. 

| Metric                    | Value This Month | Change    | Reaction |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | -------- |

| Trial Conversion Rate     | 1%               | -75%      | ☺️       |

Even though total active users for the month didn't increase, weekly active users seemed to 
go up slightly. Here's what the trend looks like

I've mentioned this in previous recaps, but I've always had a hunch that a 
significant portion of early adopters were still unaware of Insomnia' paid plans (there were
none in the early days). So, I finally did something to remind them. I
**added a simple push notification** to prompt users to upgrade every 30 launches 💬.

Shortly after implementing the notification, I checked the stats and observed that many
of July's new customers had launched the app **over 100 times**! My hypothesis was correct.

Now I'm left wondering what other money I've been leaving on the table.
