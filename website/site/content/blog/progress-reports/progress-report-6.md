As Insomnia slowly grows into a sustainable business it becomes more and more difficult to 
find things to put in these updates. I'm currently heads-down putting the finishing touches on
a **very major release** so, instead of spending a day or two drafting and editing a recap, 
I'm choosing to keep this one short and focus on the release ahead. Don't worry, though. Next
month's release will be jam-packed.

## March Metrics Overview

March's metrics are still growing, but at a slightly lower rate than usual. 

| Metric                    | Value This Month | Change    | Reaction   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Active App Users          | 22,089           | +20%      | &#x1f60a;  |        
| New App Users             | 9,373            | +19%      | &#x1f60a;  |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | $490             | +52%      | &#128578;  |
| Recognized Revenue        | $640             | +4%       | &#128528;  |
| New Trial Customers       | 203              | -10%      | &#128551;  |
| New Paying Customers      | 22               | +10%      | &#128578;  |
| Churned Customers         | 3                | +&infin;% | &#128543;  |
| Trial Conversion Rate     | 11%              | +22%      | &#128578;  |

The most notable thing here is that Insomnia had it's first real churn. This doesn't 
seem like a big deal yet, but I'll definitely be keeping an eye on it. I _did_ 
try to reach out to the churned customers but failed to get a response from any, which is
bothersome.

Over the last few months, user growth has slowly decreased from +30% to +20%. I would like to
keep this number above 20% for as long as possible, so I'll be doing some extra PR this month
to try and push it back up.

Similar to user growth, revenue growth has also been declining steadily. This is expected,
however, because revenue and user growth should be the same (+20%) if conversion rate 
remains constants.

## Wrap Up

That's it for this month. As I mentioned earlier, this recap was intentionally short. 
I have some awesome things ready to release in a few days, so keep an eye out for that. There
will definitely be a lot to talk about next month!

As always, let me know if you have any feedback or thoughts, and enjoy the app.
