I spent most of August getting ready to go on a
[long-term travel trip](https://schier.co/blog/2017/08/06/moving-into-a-30-liter-backpack/), 
meaning not much got done in August. As a result, this recap will be quite short.

## Metrics Overview

Even though August was a slow month, things are still growing at a healthy rate. 
Recognized revenue is down but that's because a large team purchased an annual subscription 
the month prior.

I'm still very satisfied with the rate of growth of Insomnia, and I look forward to continue
working on it as I travel the globe for the next year.
