If you were to ask me which month has felt the most like a roller coaster, it 
would have been June. Major community-developed features were released ðŸ¦„, a blog post 
[hit front page ðŸ˜„](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14622528) of Hacker News, 
Smashing Magazine [tweeted about Insomnia ðŸ¤—](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/872165992708927488), 
the first churn of Insomnia Teams happened ðŸ˜¤, and there were an annoyingly large 
increase of failed payments ðŸ˜¤. And, to top it all off, June's metrics look extremely sad
due to the huge spike of traffic that happened in May ðŸ˜³.

There's one every month!_

## Metrics Overview

This month's metrics are low across the board due to the spike of traffic the previous month.
However, I'm surprised that the number of paid conversions is so low
because the 14 day trials from the traffic spike should have started converting at the 
beginning of the month. 

My theory for the lack of conversions is that, because the announcement was centered around
_free open source software_, it was more likely to attract users who don't typically buy
software. There's really no way to prove this, but I think the overall effect of more 
users is still a net win. 

| Metric                    | Value This Month | Change    | Reaction   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Active App Users          | 33,995           | +2%       | &#x1f610;  |        
| New App Users             | 13,349           | -19%      | &#128551;  |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | $925             | +9%       | &#x1f610;  |
| Recognized Revenue        | $1332            | +8%       | &#x1f610;  |
| New Trial Customers       | 415              | -9%       | &#128551;  |
| New Paying Customers      | 17               | -39%      | &#x1f610;  |
| Churned Customers         | 9                | +80%      | &#128551;  |
| Trial Conversion Rate     | 4%               | -33%      | &#x1f610;  |

As mentioned, June's metrics are lower compared to the huge increase in May. However, if
you ignore May's spike, growth is still on a similar upward path as it has been.ðŸ™‚

The first team churns happened in June, which was an unwelcome surprise. I reached out to
both team accounts, but only one replied saying that they loved Insomnia, but no longer had
a use for the application. I wish I were able to get feedback from the other team as well. 

Such a large churn bummed me out for a few days, but I bounced back pretty quick! Money has
never been much of a motivation, so I was quickly brought back into reality by all of the
other awesome things that this project brings me (writing code, community, feedback, etc).

## Wrap Up

Well that's it for this month! Along with this, I will be publishing a 1-year recap before
the end of the month, as June marked the 12th month since I've been working on Insomnia full-time. 

I've also had some requests to add a few more metrics and to these posts. I'd like to
keep the monthly recaps short and focused, but I might try to publish one-off posts to
cover notable discoveries or insights that come up. Let me know if you have any ideas in
the comments below.
