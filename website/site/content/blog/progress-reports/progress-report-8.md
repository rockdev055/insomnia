## Wrap Up

It's been a few weeks since Insomnia went open source and it's been a wild ride so far!
The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia) is now at **3,900 stars and 
127 forks**, and there are over **60 members in the [Slack Group](https://chat.insomnia.rest/)**.

The open source announcement also amassed a tonne of unexpected positivity from users.
Countless people have reached out to say "thanks" and many others have submitted bug 
reports, feature request, and pull requests.

I want to give a huge "thanks" to everyone for all the support, and I can't wait to see
what happens next!
