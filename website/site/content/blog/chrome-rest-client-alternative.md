Yesterday, [Google announced](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html) that 
it would be discontinuing Chrome Apps in mid-2017. This means that popular Chrome-based REST clients like 
[Insomnia (2.0)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/insomnia-rest-client/gmodihnfibbjdecbanmpmbmeffnmloel?hl=en), 
[Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en),
[Advanced REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo), and
[DHC](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhc-rest-client/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm) will
become unavailable.

Luckily, there are many non-Chrome alternatives to choose from so you can quickly get on with your
work. Here are some of the most popular alternatives.


## Insomnia 3.0 (Mac, Windows, and Linux)

[Insomnia](/download) (what you're looking at), is a well-designed cross-platform REST client.
It's free, easy to use, and offers advanced features like cookie management, global environments, 
and code snippet generation.

## Postman Desktop (Mac and Windows)

[Postman](http://getpostman.com/) is probably the most popular REST client. It offers advanced
features like automated API testing, team collaboration (paid), and even documentation generation. 
It's vast feature list makes it a bit harder to learn than other clients, but it's very powerful 
once you get up and running.

_Update Aug 22, 2016: Postman now has a
[blog post](http://blog.getpostman.com/2016/08/23/using-the-postman-chrome-app-implications-from-the-recent-google-announcement/) 
on the Chrome App shutdown as well._


## Paw (Mac) $

[Paw](https://luckymarmot.com/paw) is a fully native and well-designed desktop app for Mac. It 
offers many of the same features as Postman, and is easy to use due to the teams' focus on design. 
Paw comes in at a $50 (USD) price tag but offers a 30 day free trial as well as a 30% discount for students.


## HTTPie (Command Line)

[HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) is a very intuitive command line tool that makes 
interacting with HTTP APIs a joy. If you aren't looking for a visual application, I definitely
recommend checking it out.
