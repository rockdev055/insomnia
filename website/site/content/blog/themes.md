Superb design has always been treated as a core feature of Insomnia. However, I recently
noticed that no design-related work had been done on Insomnia in months. Because of this, 
I decided to spend a few days and implement a new design-related feature. Themes!

There are now **nine themes to choose from**. Three _basic_ and
and six _premium_. Basic themes are available to everyone, while premium themes
are available [Insomnia Plus](/pricing/) users.

## Basic Themes

The idea of themes first started as a way to provide better visual accessibility to 
Insomnia users. The following _Basic_ themes provide a higher-contrast experience for
users who want or need it.

## Premium Themes

The following _Premium_ themes are available to all [Insomnia Plus](/pricing/) users. I had
a lot of fun creating these, and I hope to expand on this collection in the future.

For a closer look, here is a larger screenshot of the Material theme (my favourite).

I hope you enjoy the new colors. Let me know if you have any suggestions for more!
