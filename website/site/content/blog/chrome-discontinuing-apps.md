**Don't worry!**
The Chrome version of Insomnia will be available until 2017, but you should upgrade to the
[standalone version (3.0)](/download) as soon as possible.

</p>

Google [announced today](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html) that they
will be phasing out Chrome Apps by mid-2017. This means that the Chrome version (2.0) of Insomnia
will become unavailable.

> We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and 
> Linux over the next two years. 

To make sure that you are unaffected by this change, [upgrade](/download) to the 
standalone version (3.0) today which is supported on Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms. After
installation, export your data from 2.0 and import it into 3.0. Then, carry on with your work 
and enjoy the new features like 
[cookie management](/documentation/cookie-management),
[global environments](/documentation/environment-variables), and
[code snippet generation](/documentation/code-snippets).
