Today, I'm proud to introduce Insomnia Plus â€“ the first paid addition to Insomnia 
that syncs data seamlessly across all of your devices. Insomnia Plus also acts as 
a secure backup, so you can _rest_ assured that you will never accidentally 
lose your work!

With Plus, simply sign into your account and your data will be there. It 
just works. However, there a lot happening behind the scenes, such as 
**end-to-end data encryption**, **smart conflict resolution**, and robust **offline
support**.

## Always Backed up and in Sync

We all know how important it is to keep frequent backups of our data. Hard drive 
failures and crashes happen all the time. Now, you have one less thing to worry 
about.

Once signed in to Plus, data is automatically synced whenever a change is 
detected. And, if you are signed in to multiple devices, these changes 
will automatically be pulled down and merged within seconds. Furthermore,
this all happens in an encrypted and secure manner. 


## Secure and Private by Default

Before any data is synced to Insomnia's servers, it is first **encrypted locally** using a
key generated on your device. This means that any sensitive information you
enter into the app (API keys, passwords, etc) will be kept private. **Not even the Insomnia
servers have the ability to read your data.**

on the Insomnia Plus architecture._

## Final Words

Building the initial iteration of sync was a major effort, but it's just the first 
step. Now, with a stable and secure foundation to build on, expect to see more advanced 
features like **team collaboration** and **versioning** in the near future.

If you decide to sign up for Plus, I'd like to say a huge _THANK YOU_ for helping 
support my continuous effort of making Insomnia awesome! Also, be sure to reach out 
with your thoughts, so we can work together to ensure the product keeps heading 
in the right direction.
