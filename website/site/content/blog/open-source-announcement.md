Today, I'm happy to announce that the Insomnia desktop app is now open source software 
under the GPLv3 license! The source code is hosted on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/getinsomnia/insomnia) for your viewing pleasure.

## Journey to Open Source

I launched Insomnia more than two years ago with no expectation that it would grow to
over 30,000 monthly users. This growth motivated me to leave my job in July of 2016 
and is still the main reason I wake up every morning. Before the transition to full-time,
I set a goal of [documenting the journey](/transparency) as transparently as 
possible so that others could benefit from my mistakes and successes.
Now, ten months later, it's time to fit the open-source piece into the 
transparency puzzle.

So why not open-source sooner? **Fear**. Fear of public judgement, fear of being 
told my code sucks, fear of showing how much time I spent on it. Being independent 
leaves you wide open with nothing to hide behind. You _are_ the product, and the 
product embodies _your_ personality. If the product is a failure, so are _you_. Exposing 
the code that powers the product just adds another dimension to criticise. That's what 
the voices in my head keep repeating, anyway.

The truth is that the fear I feel is irrational. Life is too short to avoid following your
dreams and the Internet has a terrible memory anyway. So, here I am, setting my fear aside
to continue on with the next phase of the journey.

See you on the other side &#x1f37b;
