Only a week has gone by since the last update, but a lot has changed. This release introduces three 
brand new features â€“ cookie management, global environment variables, and code snippet generation!

## Cookie Management

The ability to manage cookies has been the most requested feature (by far) of the beta, so I'm 
pleased to announce that you can now do it!

Easily view and manage cookies in a simple yet powerful interface. Cookies are automatically stored 
and sent with every request, just as you would expect. cookies.png There is a new button at the top 
of the sidebar to open the cookie manager. You can also now view cookies sent back in a response by 
clicking on the cookies tab.

## Global Environments

The previous version of Insomnia already had the ability to define environment variables, but it 
was at the folder level. Now you can define environments globally (workspace level) and even 
create sub-environments that you can quickly switch between. environments.png You can access the 
environment manager by clicking the new dropdown at the top of the sidebar.

## Code Snippet Generation

You can now automatically generate code snippets for over thirty different languages and libraries, 
including NodeJS, Go, Swift, Python, Java, and C. Access it by clicking the dropdown next to the 
request in the sidebar. code.png
