# Insomnia Landing

This is the source code for [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest), built with
[Hugo Static Website Engine](https://gohugo.io/) and 
[Speedpack](https://github.com/gschier/speedpack) to compress static assets on
deploy.

```shell
# run watch server (production)
npm start

# run watch server (with drafts)
npm run dev

# build to _hugo/
npm run build

# deploy (need Surge.sh access)
npm run deploy
```
